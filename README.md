# RainbowDQN for Super Mario Bros.

This project involved training a deep reinforcement learning agent using modern techinques. It involved reading and implementing algorithms from current research. The main paper used was ["Combining Improvements in Deep Reinforcement Learning"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.02298.pdf) which is a paper combining many techniques, published by DeepMind, 2017.
